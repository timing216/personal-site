      <p>
        I have devoted myself to the practice of meditation for the past 47
        years, and whenever I attain a meditative state, I feel as though I
        have tapped into an infinite source of energy and creativity. As a
        part of my daily routine, I make it a point to meditate every morning
        upon waking up from sleep.

      <p>
        I derive great pleasure from cooking, primarily because of the easy
        accessibility of recipes over the internet, and the assurance of
        knowing exactly what I will be consuming. I firmly believe that it is
        crucial to be aware of the components that make up one's diet, as they
        significantly impact both the mind and body.

      <h2>Ukiyoe Art Collection</h2>
      <img class="image" src="img/ukiyoe.png" width="360" height="240" alt="Ukiyoe" />
      <p>
        I have a collection of Ukiyoe prints that were created during the late
        Edo period, also known as the woodblock printing era in Japan's latter
        half of the 1800s. Although it is common to observe some color fading
        in the original prints, it is worth noting that all colors utilized in
        that era were sourced from natural ingredients, lending them an
        overall soft and gentle appearance. It was during this time that
        European artists began studying the Ukiyoe art style, and notable
        artists such as Vincent Van Gogh's painting style show great influence
        from Ukiyoe art.
